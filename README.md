# Weather Application

The Weather Application provides an overview of weather conditions in the specified city with an option to add cities to favorites. "Weather in other cities" provides access to random major cities and their current weather.

** Please start the application using Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code ** <br>
** To check the weather in your desired city, type the city name in the search bar, then press ENTER **

# Key Features

Designing and building the Weather Application taught me a lot since it was my first time using an API to pull live data. Here's an overview of the features I created and some of the key topics I tackled:

-   Five day forecast for the current city
-   Section that shows a random list of 3 major cities every time the page is loaded
-   Favorite section: allows the user to add/remove cities to favorites section
-   Simply switch to another city by clicking on one of the cities in the "other" or "favorite" section
-   Created reusable functions to make API calls for searches, geolocation, and clicking on the cities in the "other" or "favorite" sections
-   Responsive application
-   Animated icons
-   Built using <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeather API</a>
